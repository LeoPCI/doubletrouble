// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application-head.js, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
// or any plugin's vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file.
//
// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
// about supported directives.
//
// ABOUT APPLICATION-HEAD.js: by zubietaroberto
// this file will be loaded inside the <head> tag of the site. Therefore it must
// be as slim as possible. Non-crucial JS should be loaded in the
// application-body.js file instead.
//
// TLDR: DO NOT ADD FILES HERE. Use application-body instead.
